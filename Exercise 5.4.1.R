#Exercise 5.4.1
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

#2) What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?
#nikolas riapira
x <- flights %>%
  select(distance, distance, distance, distance, distance)
  view(x)

#3) What does the any_of() function do?

  #missing variables
  w <- flights %>%
    select(any_of("distance"))
  view(w)

  #hide the variable
  w <- flights %>%
    select(-any_of("distance"))
  view(w)

#3.1) Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?


  vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay", "carrier")

  #missing variables
    z <- flights %>%
      select(-any_of(vars))
    view(z)

  #Hide the other variables

    z <- flights %>%
      select(any_of(vars))
    view(z)

#4Does the result of running the following code surprise you?
#4.1How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?

  select(flights, contains("TIME"))

#4.2 How can you change that default?

  #solution with any_of

  library(tidyverse)
  library(nycflights13)
  vars <- c("dep_time", "sched_dep_time", "arr_time", "sched_arr_time", "air_time","time_hour")
  a <- flights %>%
    select(any_of(vars))
  view(a)
